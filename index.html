      // Hangman in JavaScript:
      // 1. First, you'll need to create a list of words that the player will guess. You can store these words in an array.
      // 2. Next, you'll need to choose a random word from the array.
      // 3. Then, you'll need to display the word as underscores on the screen.
      // 4. When the player guesses a letter, you'll need to check if the letter is in the word.
      // 5. If the letter is in the word, you'll need to replace the underscore with the letter.
      // 6. If the letter is not in the word, you'll need to add it to a list of incorrect guesses.
      // 7. You'll also need to keep track of how many incorrect guesses the player has made.
      // 8. Finally, you'll need to check if the player has won or lost.

      const words = ['javascript', 'html', 'css', 'react', 'angular'];
      const word = words[Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length)];
      const answerArray = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        answerArray[i] = '_';
      }
      let remainingLetters = word.length;
      while (remainingLetters > 0) {
        alert(answerArray.join(' '));
        const guess = prompt('Guess a letter, or click Cancel to stop playing.');
        if (guess === null) {
          break;
        } else if (guess.length !== 1) {
          alert('Please enter a single letter.');
        } else {
          for (let j = 0; j < word.length; j++) {
            if (word[j] === guess) {
              answerArray[j] = guess;
              remainingLetters--;
            }
          }
